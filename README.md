# HackNJIT_2023 - Message in a Bottle
YeJu Lee, Steven Packard

## Description
This website aims to act like a message in a bottle that bubbles up to the top of the page when it is submitted.

## Issues we ran into: 
* Learning from scratch: Though YeJu had dabbled in HTML years before, she had to relearn from the beginning. She also taught herself CSS during the 25 hours of the Hackathon.

* Issues with picture: easily fixed with "background-size = cover"

* Difference in pixel size: use percentages instead of pixel
